Title: Complex demodulation for epidemic time series data
Version: 0.1.0

Description: This package is used for applying the method of complex demodulation, a mathematical time series analysis method,
    to seasonal infectious disease data. There are three main components to complex demodulation: demodulate; filter; and extract.
    First, apply a 'demodulator' function with a periodicity that is equivalent to the dominant period in your dataset. Then, apply a filter,
    where the default is a centred moving average filter. Finally, extract the amplitude and phase.
